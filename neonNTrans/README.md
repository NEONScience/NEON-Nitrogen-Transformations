<!-- ****** Description ****** -->
This package is for calculating soil extractable inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations and net N transformation rates (mineralization and nitrification) from soil KCl extracts.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
Usage
-----

The single function contained in this package, def.calc.ntrans, has the following purpose: (1) join variables across tables (2) calculate blank-corrected inorganic N concentrations in KCl extracts (3) convert from N concentrations in extracts (mg N/L) to soil extractable N concentrations (ug N/g dry soil), and (4) calculate net N mineralization and nitrification rates using intital and incubated core pairs. See the function help file for additional details. The general flow of using this package is:

1.  Download data for NEON.DP1.10080, Soil inorganic nitrogen pools and transformations.
2.  *Recommended Workflow* Use functions from the neonUtilities package (in the NEON-utilities repository <https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities> or on CRAN) to download files and/or read files directly into R. See neonUtilities package README for more details.

         library(devtools) 
         install_github("NEONScience/NEON-utilities/neonUtilties", dependencies=TRUE)  
         library(neonUtilties)  
         NTR <- loadByProduct(site = "LENO", dpID = "DP1.10080.001", package = "basic", check.size = F)

3.  Alternatively, download files manually from the NEON data portal.
4.  Load the def.calc.ntrans package:

         install_github("NEONScience/NEON-Nitrogen-Transformations/neonNTrans", dependencies=TRUE)  
         library(neonNTrans)  

5.  Run the function with data loaded to R using the loadByProduct() example above

        out <- def.calc.ntrans(kclInt = NTR$ntr_internalLab, 
                               kclIntBlank = NTR$ntr_internalLabBlanks, 
                               kclExt = NTR$ntr_externalLab, 
                               soilMoist = NTR$sls_soilMoisture)

6.  Alternatively, run the function with files for each of the four required input tables loaded manually

        df1 <- "path/to/data/ntr_internalLab"
        df2 <- "path/to/data/ntr_internalLabBlanks"
        df3 <- "path/to/data/ntr_ntr_externalLab"
        df4 <- "path/to/data/sls_soilMoisture"
        out <- def.calc.ntrans(kclInt = df1, kclIntBlank = df2, kclExt = df3, soilMoist = df4) 

    Returns a data frame with inorganic N concentrations in ug N per g dry soil and net N transformation rates in ug N per g per day for incubated samples if data from both initial and final cores are available. Defaults to keepAll = F, meaning the output is a simplified dataframe containing only sample information, critical input variables, and calculated outputs. Function will not run if inorganic N concentrations from KCl extractions are not yet available.

Calculation Summary
-------------------

The first step in converting inorganic N concentrations in KCl extracts to soil extractable inorganic N is to blank-correct the concentration values (mg/L) for each sample. This is necessary because blanks can contain substantial ammounts of ammonium and nitrate, and this contaminant N must be accounted for. The def.calc.ntrans function thus estimates mean N concentration in the set of blanks associated with each batch of samples (typically, n = 3), then subtracts the mean blank value from measured ammonium and nitrate+nitrite N concentrations. When this results in a negative number, the sample concentration is set to 0.

Next, blank-corrected concentrations are converted from milligrams N per liter to micrograms N per gram by dividing by the mass of dry soil extracted and multiplying by extraction volume. To calculate the mass of dry soil extracted, the def.calc.ntrans function multiplies the mass of field-moist soil extracted by the dry mass fraction provided for each sample in the soil moisture table.

Lastly, if data are available for both an initial and final core in the pair, net N mineralization is calculated as the difference in final minus initial inorganic N (ammonium plus nitrate+nitrite N), divided by the incubation length. Net nitrification is calucated as the difference between final and intital nitrate+nitrite N, divided by the incubation length.

For a more detailed breakdown of these calculations and a full list of all variables generated by the def.calc.ntrans function, see the NEON Data Product User Guide for Soil inorganic nitrogen pools and transformations (NEON.DP1.10080), available at the NEON Data Portal in the Resources &gt; Document Library section or here: <http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON_nTrans_userGuide_vA>.

Note that the def.calc.ntrans function provides a summary of how many records are missing soil concentration estimates due to lack of dry mass fraction data in the soil moisture table. Moreover, when users decide to drop data based on specific sample condition values or data quality flags (see function help file for details), the function also provides a summary of the number of records affected.
