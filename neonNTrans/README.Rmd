<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This package is for calculating soil extractable inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations and net N transformation rates (mineralization and nitrification) from NEON soil KCl extracts.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## Usage
The single function contained in this package, def.calc.ntrans, has the following purpose: (1) join variables across tables (2) calculate blank-corrected inorganic N concentrations in KCl extracts (3) convert from N concentrations in extracts (mg N/L) to soil extractable N concentrations (ug N/g dry soil), and (4) calculate net N mineralization and nitrification rates using intital and incubated core pairs. See the function help file for additional details. The general flow of using this package is:

1. Download data for NEON.DP1.10086, Soil physical and chemical properties, periodic.
2. _Recommended Workflow_ Use functions from the neonUtilities package (on CRAN) to download files and/or read files directly into R. See neonUtilities package documentation for more details.
```
 library(neonUtilties)  
 soilData <- loadByProduct(site = c("LENO", "HARV", "WREF"), dpID = "DP1.10086.001", package = "basic", check.size = F)
```
3. Alternatively, download files manually from the NEON data portal, or via some other mechanism.
4. Load the def.calc.ntrans package:  
```
 library(devtools) 
 install_github("NEONScience/NEON-Nitrogen-Transformations/neonNTrans", dependencies=TRUE)  
 library(neonNTrans)  
```
5. Run the function with data loaded to R using the loadByProduct() example above, with option to specify flagged data to be excluded.
```
out <- def.calc.ntrans(kclInt = soilData$ntr_internalLab, kclIntBlank = soilData$ntr_internalLabBlanks, kclExt = soilData$ntr_externalLab, soilMoist = soilData$sls_soilMoisture, dropAmmoniumFlags = "blanks exceed sample value", dropNitrateFlags = "blanks exceed sample value" )
```
6. Alternatively, run the function with files for each of the four required input tables loaded manually, with option to specify conditions where data should be excluded.
```
df1 <- "path/to/data/ntr_internalLab"
df2 <- "path/to/data/ntr_internalLabBlanks"
df3 <- "path/to/data/ntr_ntr_externalLab"
df4 <- "path/to/data/sls_soilMoisture"
out <- def.calc.ntrans(kclInt = df1, kclIntBlank = df2, kclExt = df3, soilMoist = df4, dropConditions = c("deprecatedMethod", "other")) 
```
Returns a list of dataframes, at least 2 are always included and up to 5 may be returned depending on specified function parameters. data_summary will be most useful to end users as it succinctly provides inorganic N concentrations in ug N per g dry soil plus net N transformation rates in ug N per g per day for incubated samples if data from both initial and final cores are available. all_data is provided so that end users can see all of the calculations that went in to the final estimates. The other data frames are summaries of which records were excluded due to conditions, flags, or missing soil moisture values. Note that the function will not run if inorganic N concentrations from KCl extractions are not yet available from external lab analyses.

<!-- ****** Calculation Summary ****** -->
## Calculation Summary
The first step in converting inorganic N concentrations in KCl extracts to soil extractable inorganic N is to  blank-correct the concentration values (mg/L) for each sample. This is necessary because blanks can contain substantial ammounts of ammonium and nitrate, and this contaminant N must be accounted for. The def.calc.ntrans function thus estimates mean N concentration in the set of blanks associated with each batch of samples (typically, n = 3), then subtracts the mean blank value from measured ammonium and nitrate+nitrite N concentrations. When this results in a negative number, the sample concentration is set to 0. See function help for more discussion of this topic and a suggestion for dealing with highly negative sample values.

Next, blank-corrected concentrations are converted from milligrams N per liter to micrograms N per gram by dividing by the mass of dry soil extracted and multiplying by extraction volume. To calculate the mass of dry soil extracted, the def.calc.ntrans function multiplies the mass of field-moist soil extracted by the dry mass fraction provided for each sample in the soil moisture table.

Lastly, if data are available for both an initial and final core in the pair, net N mineralization is calculated as the difference in final minus initial inorganic N (ammonium plus nitrate+nitrite N), divided by the incubation length. Net nitrification is calculated as the difference between final and initial nitrate+nitrite N, divided by the incubation length.

For a more detailed breakdown of these calculations and a full list of all variables generated by the def.calc.ntrans function, see the NEON Data Product User Guide for Soil inorganic nitrogen pools and transformations (NEON.DP1.10086), available at the NEON Data Portal in the Resources > Document Library section or the data product landing page: https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10086.001.

Note that the def.calc.ntrans function provides a summary of how many records are missing soil concentration estimates due to lack of dry mass fraction data in the soil moisture table. Moreover, when users decide to drop data based on specific sample condition values or data quality flags (see function help file for details), the function also provides a summary of the number of records affected.
